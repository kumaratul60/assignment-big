## Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to generate these wireframes as a starting point for my development.

## Key functionality 

### Winners

The purpose of this function is to get back all the winners from an array that stores multiple games with 2 players in each and their respective scores. The next step is to shuffle and split the flat array to create a new round of games. 

```js
const winners = (games) => {
    let result = games.map(game => game.reduce((winner, player) => player.score > winner.score ? player : winner));
    return result;
};
``` 

### Shuffle 
The purpose of this function to shuffle an array. The application of this functon is to take an array of player objects and shuffle them into a random order. This function is based on the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.

```js
const shuffle = array => {

    let index = array.length;
    let temp, random;

    while (index !== 0) {
        random = Math.floor(Math.random() * index);
        index -= 1;

        temp = array[index];
        array[index] = array[random];
        array[random] = temp;
    };

    return array;
};
```

### Split 

The purpose of this function to split an array into chunks. The application of this functon is to split an array of player objects into multiple games.

```js
const split = players => {
    let result = [];
    let teams = Math.floor(players.length / (players.length / 2));

    while (players.length) {
        result.push(players.splice(0, teams));
    }

    return result;
};
```

### Scoring

The scoring functionality is too complex to display here. To understand it, find and open [score.notes.js](./src/data/functions/score.notes.js) which explains everything.
